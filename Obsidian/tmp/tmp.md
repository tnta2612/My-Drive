Hi 

@Michael, I hope you still remember me :) I'm An and I used to work with you and Nikolai on my Bachelor thesis. Now I'm here again and and asking you and Adian for another topic for my Master thesis.

I have finished my second semester of my Master study. My Grade Report is included in this email, but it han't been completely updated yet. Therefore, I'd like to explain a bit more about my current progress in my study so that you have a better overview of me. In the last semester, I did two internships each of 10 ECTS. Both haven't gone into my Grade Report yet. Additionally, I'm also doing an IDP project at the moment which is 16 ECTS. It is about to end in May. So a part from the Grade Report, I only need a Master thesis and 7 ECTS more to complete my study. Therefore, I'd like to begin with a Master thesis starting from May or June. That's the reason why I'm writing this email to ask if you have any interesting security topics that I can work on for my Master thesis?

Subject: Inquiry on Master Thesis Topics in Security

Dear Michael and Adrian,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Nguyen Truong An To, and I am currently progressing to the third semester of my Master's program. @Michael, I hope you still remember me :) I'm An and I used to work with you and Nikolai on my Bachelor thesis. Now I'm here again searching for another topic for my master thesis.

Alongside this email, I have attached my Grade Report for your reference. However, I would like to point out that the document has not been fully updated to reflect my most recent academic endeavors. Therefore, I feel it is pertinent to provide you with a more comprehensive overview of my current status and achievements in the program.

In the last semester, I had the opportunity to engage in two internships at the university, each valued at 10 ECTS. Yet they are not currently reflected in the attached Grade Report. Furthermore, I am in the midst of completing an IDP project for 16 ECTS, which is set to conclude in May. Aside from the information provided in the Grade Report, the completion of my Master's degree hinges on a successful Master's thesis and the accumulation of an additional 7 ECTS. With this in mind, I am eager to embark on my Master's thesis, with a proposed start date in May or June. 

While searching for a topic for my Master thesis, I saw your post on the website of chair of IT Security, which is about "Certificate Transparency for Third-Party-Operated Industrial PKI". This topic quickly caught my interest because, you know, I also work in the context of IACS in my Bachelor thesis before. Therefore, I'd like to ask if this topic is still available?

Also, given my keen interest in the realm of security, I am also reaching out to inquire if you have any other suggestions for intriguing topics within this domain that I could explore for my thesis. I am open to diverse areas within the field of security and am particularly interested in topics that blend theoretical knowledge with practical application.

I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss potential thesis topics further, either through email correspondence or a meeting at your convenience. Your guidance and support would be instrumental in helping me identify a topic that not only aligns with my academic and professional aspirations but also contributes meaningfully to the field.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I look forward to the possibility of working closely with you on this critical component of my Master's program.

Warm regards,

Nguyen Truong An To
